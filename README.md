# Scikit--Imbalanced-learn-Supervised-Learning
Use **Python (Scikit-learn, and Imbalanced-learn)** to build and evaluate several **machine learning** models to predict credit risk. 

## Steps
•	Explain how a machine learning algorithm is used in data analytics. <br>
•	Create *training and test* groups from a given data set.<br>
•	Implement the **logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector** machine algorithms.<br>
•	Compare the *advantages and disadvantages* of each supervised learning algorithm.<br>
•	Determine which supervised learning algorithm is best used for a given data set or scenario.<br>
•	Use **ensemble and resampling techniques** to improve model performance.<br>

## Discussion
Build and evaluate several machine learning models to assess credit risk, using data from LendingClub; a peer-to-peer lending services company.

•	Implement machine learning models. <br>
•	Use resampling to attempt to address **class imbalance**.<br>
•	Evaluate the performance of machine learning models.<br>
